I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University under Professor  <a href = 'https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/david-s-matteson'> David S. Matteson</a>. My resarch interest is in Bayesian Time-series Analysis. In our most recent work, we present a novel method for estimating time-varying volatility model called Adaptive Stochastic Volatility (ASV). You may find the preprint in this <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11315"> link </a>. 

Before joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my Masters degree in animal science, specializing in Precision Agriculture under professor <a href='http://nmsp.cals.cornell.edu/about/bios/quirine.html'> Quirine M. Ketterings</a>, <a href='http://guinness.cals.cornell.edu/'> Joe Guinness</a> and <a href='https://www.rit.edu/directory/jvacis-jan-van-aardt'> Jan van Aardt</a>. My research focused on the spatio-temporal analysis of yield monitor data, high-resolution geo-referenced yield estimates, and development of statistical tools to help farmers make better nutrient management decisions.

I am also actively looking for an internship position for Summer 2025.
