I am a second year Ph.D. student in Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University. My broad research interest is in financial statistics and my most recent work was on the analysis of NFT transactions data. This summer I worked with Professor <a href = 'https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/david-s-matteson'> David S. Matteson</a> and Sven Serneels from <a href = 'https://www.higallop.com/'> Gallop Inc.</a> in analyzing <a href = 'https://doi.org/10.7298/6jcj-9461'> NFT transactions data </a>. You may find our preprint <a href = 'https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2210.07393'> here </a>. The paper was accepted and will be published on a journal named Data Science in Science. I am currently working to extend my analysis to develop a methodology for pricing an NFT, a highly illiquid asset.

Before joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my Masters degree in animal science, specializing in Precision Agriculture under professor <a href='http://nmsp.cals.cornell.edu/about/bios/quirine.html'> Quirine M. Ketterings</a>, <a href='http://guinness.cals.cornell.edu/'> Joe Guinness</a> and <a href='https://www.rit.edu/directory/jvacis-jan-van-aardt'> Jan van Aardt</a>. We closely worked with large dairy farms in New York in conducting various on-farm research trials. My research focused on analyzing yield monitor data, geo-referenced data on crop yield, in order to develop statistical tools to help farmers in making better nutrient management decision.

I am also actively looking for an internship position for Summer 2023.
