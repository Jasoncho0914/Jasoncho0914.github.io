I am a second year Ph.D. student in Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University. I also completed both of my Master of Science in Animal Science and Bachelor of Arts in Statistics at Cornell University.

For my Masters, I specialized in Precision Agriculture and was advised by professor <a href='http://nmsp.cals.cornell.edu/about/bios/quirine.html'> Quirine M. Ketterings</a>, <a href='http://guinness.cals.cornell.edu/'> Joe Guinness</a> and <a href='https://www.rit.edu/directory/jvacis-jan-van-aardt'> Jan van Aardt</a>. We closely worked with large dairy farms in New York in conducting various on-farm research trials. My research focused on analyzing yield monitor data, geo-referenced data on crop yield, in order to develop statistical tools to help farmers in making better nutrient management decision.

I also worked as a data analyst at Cornell Statistical Consulting Unit (CSCU) for 6 months, where I helped researchers around Cornell in performing data analysis for their research.

Currently, I am exploring various research areas in statistics with broad interest in financial statistics and time-series analysis. This summer, I worked with Professor David S. Matteson and Sven Serneels in analyzing <a href = 'https://doi.org/10.7298/6jcj-9461'>NFT transactions data </a> and wrote a data note exploring various peculiarities about the data.

I am also actively looking for an internship position for Summer 2023.
