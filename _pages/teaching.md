<h2> Course Description</h2>
<h3>[STSCI 2150]:Introductory Statistics for Biology</h3>
<span>
This course provides an introduction to data analysis using R and statistical inference illustrated with biological applications. The course covers concepts such as population vs sample, graphical display of data, numerical methods for summarizing and describing data, probability, expectation and variance, estimation, hypothesis testing such as goodness-of-fit tests, test of single proportions, analysis of variance (ANOVA), applications of various probability distributions such as normal, binomial and poisson distributions and simple/multiple linear regression.
</span>
<h3>[ORIE 3500]:Engineering Probability and Statistics II</h3>
<span>
The is a second course in probability for undergraduate students majoring in Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE).Probabilistic ideas are used to construct models for engineering problems, and statistical methods are used to test and estimate parameters for these models. Specific topics include random variables, probability distributions, density functions, expectation and variance, multidimensional random variables, and important distributions including normal, Poisson, exponential, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and point estimation using maximum likelihood and the method of moments.
